# jpg-custom-difficulties
json files of difficulties that I have created for the Deep Rock Galactic mod Custom Difficulty (https://mod.io/g/drg/m/custom-difficulty)

# Main Difficulties
These are the "high-effort" difficulties I've created, intended to be another way to enjoy a 6x2-esque experience in modded DRG.
Currently, these difficulties consist of:
- 6x2 Breeder Edition (6x2B)
- 6x2 w/ Sentinels and Fire Bombers (6x2SEFB, with rc1 and rc4 denoting version)
- Lunatic (Lx2)
- Send It!

# Meme Difficulties
Self-explanatory, these are dumb ideas meant as jokes. Highly unbalanced and likely unplayable.

# Lx2 Alpha and Beta Versions
All of the various versions Lx2 existed as before its final version.
