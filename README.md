# jpg-custom-difficulties
json files of difficulties that I have created for the Deep Rock Galactic mod [Custom Difficulty](https://mod.io/g/drg/m/custom-difficulty).

## [Main Difficulties](https://github.com/pH-JPEG/jpg-custom-difficulties/edit/main/README.md)
These are the "high-effort" difficulties I've created, intended to be another way to enjoy a 6x2-esque experience in modded DRG. Ever since Season 4, all main difficulties will come default with Stingtails taking x2.2 damage.

Currently, these difficulties consist of:
- [6x2 Breeder Edition (6x2B)](https://github.com/pH-JPEG/jpg-custom-difficulties/blob/main/6x2B.json)
  - 6x2, but Breeders can respawn. They also spawn Shockers.
  - *Latest update:* Stingtails now take x2.2 damage. 
- 6x2 w/ Sentinels and Fire Bombers (6x2SEFB, with [rc1](https://github.com/pH-JPEG/jpg-custom-difficulties/blob/main/6x2SEFB_rc1.json) and [rc4](https://github.com/pH-JPEG/jpg-custom-difficulties/blob/main/6x2SEFB_rc4.json) denoting version)
  - 6x2, but Sentinels and Fire Bombers can spawn in missions.
  - *Latest update:* Stingtails now take x2.2 damage in both versions rc1 and rc4.
- [Lunatic (Lx2)](https://github.com/pH-JPEG/jpg-custom-difficulties/blob/main/Lx2.json)
  - My flagship difficulty, currently updated for Season 4. Features are listed [here](https://github.com/pH-JPEG/jpg-custom-difficulties/blob/main/Lx2%20Features.txt).
  - *Latest update:* Stingtails now take x2.2 damage.
  - **Disclaimer:** From an objective game design perspective, Lx2 is incredibly unbalanced. It is extremely punishing of any mistakes and highly RNG-based, with certain mission and biome combinations becoming near impossible from the start due to cave generation, encounter/stationary spawns, and nitra spawns. Build diversity no longer exists with degenerate strategies showing up more frequently. Don't expect to win even with highly experienced players. Overall, it is a major departure from 6x2 and should not be used as a metric for balancing difficulties or weapon balance discussions. That said, this difficulty is made for those who find extreme variance and occasional outright BS enjoyable while pushing their patience and the vanilla game weapons to the limit.
  - [Lx2 Simple Bug Enhance](https://github.com/pH-JPEG/jpg-custom-difficulties/blob/main/Lx2%20Simple%20Bug%20Enhance.json): Lx2 intended for use with the mod [Simple Bug Enhance](https://mod.io/g/drg/m/simple-bug-enhance). Don't use this version without Simple Bug Enhance.
  - [Lx2 Carry (Lx2C)](https://github.com/pH-JPEG/jpg-custom-difficulties/blob/main/Lx2C.json): Lx2 always scaled to 4 players independent of current player amount.
- [Send It!](https://github.com/pH-JPEG/jpg-custom-difficulties/blob/main/Send%20It!.json)
  - Takes 6x2, removes timed swarms, and causes waves of bugs to spawn frequently. Encounter and Stationary spawns are reduced.
  - *Latest update:* Stingtails now take x2.2 damage.

## [Meme Difficulties](https://github.com/pH-JPEG/jpg-custom-difficulties/tree/main/Meme%20Difficulties)
Self-explanatory, these are intentionally dumb ideas meant as jokes. Highly unbalanced and likely unplayable.

## [Lx2 Alpha and Beta Versions](https://github.com/pH-JPEG/jpg-custom-difficulties/tree/main/Lx2%20Alpha%20and%20Beta%20Versions)
All of the various versions Lx2 existed as before its final version.
