# jpg-custom-difficulties
json files of difficulties that I have created for the Deep Rock Galactic mod [Custom Difficulty](https://mod.io/g/drg/m/custom-difficulty).

## [Main Difficulties](https://github.com/pH-JPEG/jpg-custom-difficulties/edit/main/README.md)
These are the "high-effort" difficulties I've created, intended to be another way to enjoy a 6x2-esque experience in modded DRG. Ever since Season 4, all main difficulties will come default with Stingtails taking x2.2 damage.

Currently, these difficulties consist of:
- [6x2 Breeder Edition (6x2B)](https://github.com/pH-JPEG/jpg-custom-difficulties/blob/main/6x2B.json)
  - 6x2, but Breeders can respawn. They also spawn Shockers.
  - *Latest update:* Stingtails now take x2.2 damage. 
- 6x2 w/ Sentinels and Fire Bombers (6x2SEFB, with [rc1](https://github.com/pH-JPEG/jpg-custom-difficulties/blob/main/6x2SEFB_rc1.json), [rc4](https://github.com/pH-JPEG/jpg-custom-difficulties/blob/main/6x2SEFB_rc4.json), and [SK](https://github.com/pH-JPEG/jpg-custom-difficulties/blob/main/6x2SEFB-SK.json) denoting version)
  - 6x2, but Sentinels and Fire Bombers can spawn in missions.
  - [rc1](https://github.com/pH-JPEG/jpg-custom-difficulties/blob/main/6x2SEFB_rc1.json): The original release version.
  - [rc4](https://github.com/pH-JPEG/jpg-custom-difficulties/blob/main/6x2SEFB_rc4.json): The current recommended version that reduces amount of Sentinels and increases Fire Bomber amounts.
  - [SK](https://github.com/pH-JPEG/jpg-custom-difficulties/blob/main/6x2SEFB-SK.json): Based on version rc4. Stalkers can now spawn in missions.
  - *Latest update:* For versions SK and rc4, 0-weight bins have been removed. Min and Max values for EnemyDiversity have been adjusted. Bin that spawned 0% veterans in VeteranNormal removed.
- [Lunatic (Lx2)](https://github.com/pH-JPEG/jpg-custom-difficulties/blob/main/Lx2.json)
  - Where the cave madness began. Difficulty created for difficulty's sake, balance be damned. Features are listed [here](https://github.com/pH-JPEG/jpg-custom-difficulties/blob/main/Lx2%20Features.txt).
  - *Latest update:* Swarmer swarms spawn swarmers again.
  - **Disclaimer:** From an objective game design perspective, Lx2 is incredibly unbalanced. It is extremely punishing of any mistakes and highly RNG-based, with certain mission and biome combinations becoming near impossible from the start due to cave generation, encounter/stationary spawns, and nitra spawns. Build diversity no longer exists with degenerate strategies showing up more frequently. Don't expect to win even with highly experienced players. Overall, it is a major departure from 6x2 and should not be used as a metric for balancing difficulties or weapon balance discussions. That said, this difficulty is made for those who find extreme variance and occasional outright BS enjoyable while pushing their patience and the vanilla game weapons to the limit.
  - [Lx2 Simple Bug Enhance](https://github.com/pH-JPEG/jpg-custom-difficulties/blob/main/Lx2%20Simple%20Bug%20Enhance.json): Lx2 intended for use with the mod [Simple Bug Enhance](https://mod.io/g/drg/m/simple-bug-enhance). You start with a resupply. Don't use this version without Simple Bug Enhance.
  - [Lx2 Carry (Lx2C)](https://github.com/pH-JPEG/jpg-custom-difficulties/blob/main/Lx2C.json): Lx2 always scaled to 4 players independent of current player amount.
- [Send It!](https://github.com/pH-JPEG/jpg-custom-difficulties/blob/main/Send%20It!.json)
  - Takes 6x2, removes timed swarms, and causes waves of bugs to spawn frequently. Encounter and Stationary spawns are reduced.
  - *Latest update:* Stingtails now take x2.2 damage.
- [6x2EX](https://github.com/pH-JPEG/jpg-custom-difficulties/blob/main/6x2EX.json)
  - A 6x2-based, more fair version of Lx2. More consistent and less disruptive enemy spam. Features are listed [here](https://github.com/pH-JPEG/jpg-custom-difficulties/blob/main/6x2EX%20Features.txt).
  - *Latest update:* On 4p scaling, ignited Nexuses die to one x1 dmg x1 ammo VB shot to the weakpoint. Dotty resist 80%->75%.
  - [6x2EX Simple Bug Enhance](https://github.com/pH-JPEG/jpg-custom-difficulties/blob/main/6x2EX%20Simple%20Bug%20Enhance.json): 6x2EX intended for use with the mod [Simple Bug Enhance](https://mod.io/g/drg/m/simple-bug-enhance). Don't use this version without Simple Bug Enhance.
- [Lunatic-Extra (Lx2EX)](https://github.com/pH-JPEG/jpg-custom-difficulties/blob/main/Lx2EX.json)
  - A harder version of Lx2. Features and differences from Lx2 [here](https://github.com/pH-JPEG/jpg-custom-difficulties/blob/main/Lx2EX%20Features.txt).
  - *Latest update:* Release version.
  - **Disclaimer:** As this is just Lx2 but even harder, this is more unbalanced. You have been warned.
  - [Lx2EX Simple Bug Enhance](https://github.com/pH-JPEG/jpg-custom-difficulties/blob/main/Lx2EX%20Simple%20Bug%20Enhance.json): Lx2EX intended for use with the mod [Simple Bug Enhance](https://mod.io/g/drg/m/simple-bug-enhance). Don't use this version without Simple Bug Enhance.
  - [Lx2EX Carry (Lx2EX-C)](https://github.com/pH-JPEG/jpg-custom-difficulties/blob/main/Lx2EX-C.json): Lx2EX always scaled to 4 players independent of current player amount.
- [6x2LX](https://github.com/pH-JPEG/jpg-custom-difficulties/blob/main/6x2LX.json)
  - 6x2EX, but with 4 features from Lx2EX. Additions are listed [here](https://github.com/pH-JPEG/jpg-custom-difficulties/blob/main/6x2LX%20Features.txt).
  - [6x2LX Simple Bug Enhance](https://github.com/pH-JPEG/jpg-custom-difficulties/blob/main/6x2LX%20Simple%20Bug%20Enhance.json): 6x2LX intended for use with the mod [Simple Bug Enhance](https://mod.io/g/drg/m/simple-bug-enhance). Don't use this version without Simple Bug Enhance.

## [Meme Difficulties](https://github.com/pH-JPEG/jpg-custom-difficulties/tree/main/Meme%20Difficulties)
Self-explanatory, these are intentionally dumb ideas meant as jokes. Highly unbalanced and likely unplayable.

## [Lx2 Alpha and Beta Versions](https://github.com/pH-JPEG/jpg-custom-difficulties/tree/main/Lx2%20Alpha%20and%20Beta%20Versions)
All of the various versions Lx2 existed as before its final version.

## [Lx2EX Alpha and Beta Versions](https://github.com/pH-JPEG/jpg-custom-difficulties/tree/main/Lx2EX%20Alpha%20and%20Beta%20Versions)
All of the various versions Lx2EX existed as before its final version.
