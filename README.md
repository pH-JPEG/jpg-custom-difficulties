# jpg-custom-difficulties
json files of difficulties that I have created for the Deep Rock Galactic mod [Custom Difficulty](https://mod.io/g/drg/m/custom-difficulty).

## [Main Difficulties](https://github.com/pH-JPEG/jpg-custom-difficulties/edit/main/README.md)
These are the "high-effort" difficulties I've created, intended to be another way to enjoy a 6x2-esque experience in modded DRG.
Currently, these difficulties consist of:
- [6x2 Breeder Edition (6x2B)](https://github.com/pH-JPEG/jpg-custom-difficulties/blob/main/6x2B.json)
  - 6x2, but Breeders can respawn. They also spawn Shockers. 
- 6x2 w/ Sentinels and Fire Bombers (6x2SEFB, with [rc1](https://github.com/pH-JPEG/jpg-custom-difficulties/blob/main/6x2SEFB_rc1.json) and [rc4](https://github.com/pH-JPEG/jpg-custom-difficulties/blob/main/6x2SEFB_rc4.json) denoting version)
  - 6x2, but Sentinels and Fire Bombers can spawn in missions.
- [Lunatic (Lx2)](https://github.com/pH-JPEG/jpg-custom-difficulties/blob/main/Lx2.json)
  - My flagship difficulty. Features are listed [here](https://github.com/pH-JPEG/jpg-custom-difficulties/blob/main/Lx2%20Features.txt).
- [Send It!](https://github.com/pH-JPEG/jpg-custom-difficulties/blob/main/Send%20It!.json)
  - Takes 6x2, removes timed swarms, and causes waves of bugs to spawn frequently. Encounter and Stationary spawns are reduced. 

## [Meme Difficulties](https://github.com/pH-JPEG/jpg-custom-difficulties/tree/main/Meme%20Difficulties)
Self-explanatory, these are dumb ideas meant as jokes. Highly unbalanced and likely unplayable.

## [Lx2 Alpha and Beta Versions](https://github.com/pH-JPEG/jpg-custom-difficulties/tree/main/Lx2%20Alpha%20and%20Beta%20Versions)
All of the various versions Lx2 existed as before its final version.
